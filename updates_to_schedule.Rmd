# Updates to schedule & syllabus

I reserve the right to update the syllabus, schedule, point allocation and all other components of the course as necessary.  

If changes occur after the first day of class, they will be clearly communicated in class and via email, and a revised syllabus and schedule distributed with major changes flagged.  

<!-- After reading the syllabus and completing the "Syllabus treasure hunt" assignment (which will be posted on the first day of class) feel free to contact me with any questions about course policies. -->
